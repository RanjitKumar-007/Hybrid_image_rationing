This hybrid_image_rationing model performs hybrid image preprocessing for change detection by combining image differencing, logarithmic image ratioing, and edge enhancement. 

It begins by converting two input image scales (scale_1 and scale_2) to float32 for numerical stability.

A small epsilon is added to both images to prevent division by zero, and a ratio image is computed and clipped to a reasonable range to suppress outliers. 

A logarithmic transformation is then applied to enhance contrast. Simultaneously, the absolute difference between the two images is calculated to highlight pixel-level changes, and the Laplacian operator is used to enhance edges from the difference image. 

These three components: log-ratio image, differenced image, and edge-enhanced image are fused together, and the result is normalized to the 0 to 255 range and converted to uint8 for output. 

The resulting image emphasizes meaningful changes between the inputs while preserving edge and contrast details, making it suitable for use in change detection tasks.
